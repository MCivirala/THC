THC Final Public Demo Script

--------------------------------

Introduction
 - 3 use cases (map exploration, case creation, and case management)
 - 2 roles (tenant/public, THS staff)
 - focus on clean functionality over visual flourish (something like that)

 1) Tenant (not yet logged in)
 - splash screen
 - explore view
    - aggregate view for all hotels
    - can be used to find hotels with minimal # of violations
- tap specific hotel to zoom in, mention case number
- hit hotel image to go to...
- hotel profile view
    - can see all cases for that particular hotel
    - no private info shown in public view
    - show that creating a report from this screen populates the correct hotel
- exit back to explore, switch to Cases tab
- Log in

2) Staff (logged in)
- mention how, to more fully explain the case management, we will first create a case ourself
- Create report
    - tap bottom button
    - Some fields pre-populate based on user, leave other fields blank for speed purposes
    - Add rat photo
    - Comment and tag photo, then delete (to show all functionality, of course)
    - Submit, go to validation screen, and dismiss back to case table
- Case management workflow
    a) Assign new cases
        - call out presence of newly created case in the 'New' tab (remember case id)
        - swipe to assign it to self
        - swipe to assign another case to someone else
    b) Work on cases assigned to you
        - go to 'My Cases' tab
        - tap our case to see detail view
        - in detail view, show all fields that were created previously
        - tap Email button to show email view (mention how THC specifically requested that)
        - go back to 'My Tab'
        - swipe case to close it
    c) Browse all cases
        - go to 'All' tab
        - show how the case we closed is marked here
        - show how we can see the case assigned to someone else earlier
        - search for either above cases or random predetermined case
- Celebrate
